PSNN is library what implement machine learning for python3. It very easy to install and use. The user API is designed according to the Keras. 
The main advantage over keras is that it contains backed itself. Another big advantage is its small size, which allows the library to distribute even within your final application. 
The library is suitable for small and large neural networks.
